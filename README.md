## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset
League of Legends (LOL) is a fast-paced multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game by Riot Games. Players control unique champions/characters with special abilities, battling in teams to destroy the enemy Nexus (base). Strategy, teamwork, and skill are key to winning matches. With constant updates, esports tournaments, and a massive global community, it's one of the most popular games worldwide.
We will use the LOL Diamond Ranked Games (10 Min) dataset from Kaggle [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min). This dataset contains match statistics from almost 10 0000 high-ranked games within the first 10 minutes, including player kills, vision control, jungle objectives, and gold differences.



### Problematic
Our project aims to analyze early-game factors that contribute to a team’s victory in League of Legends, moving beyond basic win rate comparisons between the blue and red teams.



## Motivation & Audience
The targetted auiences are the following:
- **average players**: We find it interesting to dive deeper into game statistics and analyze the early-game meta, to help the average player understand the game better.  
- **Esports analysts & coaches**: Providing statistical and numerical proof of the best early-game strategies that lead to success.  
- **Competitive players**: Gaining insights into effective playstyles.  
- **Game designers & analysts**: Evaluating balance in early-game mechanics.  

Rather than just predicting the winning team, our goal is to identify which gameplay decisions matter most in achieving victory. Also, as a beginner, gaining a better overall understanding of the strategies to adopt in the early game, a crucial phase at this level.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

You can find the details of the figures in the [EDA Notebook](EDA.ipynb)

## Win Distribution: Red vs. Blue Team
The dataset is balanced, with an almost equal number of wins for the blue team and red team. This indicates that the dataset does not have a bias toward one side.

## Average Gold for Winning vs. Losing Teams
The winning team consistently earns more gold than the losing team. This confirms that gold difference is a strong indicator of success.

## Average KDA for Winning vs. Losing Teams
The winning team consistently has a higher KDA, meaning kills and fewer deaths play a crucial role in determining victory.
When the blue team wins, their KDA is significantly higher than the red team’s KDA, and vice versa.

## Feature Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix](figures/correlation_matrix.png)
The correlation matrix shows that blueTotalGold and blueGoldDiff have a strong positive correlation with winning.
Other features like elite monsters taken (Herald, Dragons) and towers destroyed also show a strong impact.
Wards placed/destroyed have a weaker correlation, indicating that vision control might be a secondary factor compared to direct combat stats.

Next Steps:
	•	Perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to further analyze feature importance.
	•	Develop predictive models using the most impactful variables (gold, objectives, kills).
	•	Investigate whether early-game actions (first blood, early objectives) significantly affect the final outcome.

### Related work

This dataset, available on Kaggle, has already been explored by several users through notebooks like this one [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/servietsky/league-of-legends-what-to-do-in-first-10-min) presenting basic statistics and correlations. However, we aim to stand out by offering a more visually engaging representation of the data.

Beyond a simple statistical analysis, we also want to develop a straightforward model (probably a logistic regression) that allows a player to input their game data after 10 minutes of play. This model would predict whether they were likely to win, providing valuable insights for potential improvement.

To present our data, we may take inspiration from previous years' projects, particularly the use of a slide-based scrolling system rather than continuous scrolling. This approach can provide a more immersive and structured experience, allowing users to focus on key insights step by step.
